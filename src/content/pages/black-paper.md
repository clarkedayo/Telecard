### What is TeleCard and how does it work?

TeleCard bridges the gap between FIAT and CRYPTO so you can spend your digital assets in the real world. It's the quickest way to convert your crypto into cash and spend it at over 60 million merchants worldwide. 

You can spend your crypto without any restrictions. 

TeleCard operates on Telegram via an automated bot. It allows you to quickly issue cards, top up your balance and manage your account.

TeleCard was inspired by the need to make crypto more accessible and usable in the real world. TeleCard aims to achieve complete decentralisation.
