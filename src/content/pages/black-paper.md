### What is TeleCard and how does it work?

TeleCard bridges the gap between FIAT and CRYPTO so you can spend your digital assets in the real world. It's the quickest way to convert your crypto into cash and spend it at over 60 million merchants worldwide. 

With TeleCard you don't have to worry about KYC, AML, or any other regulatory requirements. You can spend your crypto without any restrictions. 

You can manage your cards via the TeleCard bot, and soon with the TeleCard app available both on Android and iOS.

TeleCard was inspired by the need to make crypto more accessible and usable in the real world. We believe that everyone should have the freedom to spend their digital assets without any restrictions.
